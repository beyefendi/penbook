# 1 Vulnerability Advisory Report

## 1.1 Overview

This report contains the detailed results of the penetration tests and security assessments conducted by [organization name] between [[start date] - [end date] to reveal security vulnerabilities in [product name].
The research aims to reveal potential security vulnerabilities before threat actors and take preventive measures.

As part of ethical hacking, the [product name] was installed in the laboratory environment of [organization name].
The pentest was carried out by researchers who had [sorf of] | [no] previous knowledge of the systems. 

The report includes the risk level of each vulnerability found, descriptions of the vulnerabilities, links where more detailed information can be found, examples of how the vulnerabilities can be abused, necessary information about how to mitigate the vulnerabilities, and comments and suggestions from researchers.

While determining the order to be followed in fixing the vulnerabilities, the severities specified in the technical report should play a primary role.

The report has been prepared considering that the reader has basic technical knowledge. 
For this reason, no explanation will be made about the terms used in the reports.

## 1.2 Executive summary

## 1.3 Technical summary

## 1.4 Recommendations

## 1.5 Acknowledgement
 
# 2. Vulnerabilities

## 2.1 Name your vulnerability

- Example names:
  - Authentication bypass
  - Remote code execution
  - Unauthenticated file manipulation through relative path traversal
  - Missing integrity check 

- **Vulnerability type(s):** For example;
  - CWE-353: Missing Support for Integrity Check
  - CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature
  - CWE-494: Download of Code Without Integrity Check

### Issue Description

- Descibe issue, for example
  - Missing Integrity Check in Shelly Shelly TRV 20220811-152343/v2.1.8@5afc928c allows malicious users to create a backdoor by redirecting the device to an attacker-controlled machine which serves the manipulated firmware file. The device is updated with the manipulated firmware. 
  - An issue in Shelly Shelly TRV 20220811-15234 v.2.1.8 allows a local attacker to obtain sensitive information via the Wi-Fi password parameter.

- **Attack vector:** For example;
  - Attacker sniffs the wireless traffic to obtain clear-text Wi-Fi password
  - Victim user updates the firmware with a backdoored version while DNS poisoning in the local network
  - Victim user should download and execute the attached file in the e-mail 

### Affected Function

- **Affected pruduct(s) version:** For example
  - Ruckus IoT Controller (Ruckus vRIoT) 1.5.1.0.21
  - TwinCAT OPC UA Server 3 TF 6100
  - Shelly TRV - 20220811-152343/v2.1.8@5afc928c

- Descibe affected function
  - The content of the administrator webpage of the Shelly TRV
  - Home network connected to the Internet
