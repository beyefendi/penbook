The intruder will first intercept an encrypted message and then alter the payload or header and retransmit the data packet. Actually performing replay attack which is possible when there is no verification and captured data can be re-transmitted. Some type of integrity check methods i.e. ICV are known as vulnerable. |        |          |

For this cases, it is required jamming the signal first and capturing an "unused" radio packet. Then replay attack can be successfully performed. |        |          |
